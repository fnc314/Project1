Hair Etc App
========

Backstory
====

My mother owns and operates a small hair salon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  In an attempt to bring her small business into the twenty-first century, I envisioned a way to enhance her business and the interaction with her clients.

Description
====
The goal of this app is to provide an online portal to the customers of Hair Etc, through which reservations can be scheduled.  Customers create an account through the web interface, supplying a name, phone number, and email address.  They use the email address for their log-in.  Once logged in, the customer can then schedule an appointment with the salon.  They decide the day and the time of the appointment, select the services they would like, and then pick their preferred stylist.  Once the reservation is saved, a confirmation text is then sent to the selected stylist with the newly created appointment.  The text message contains the client's name, the appointment date and time, and the client's phone number.  The stylist will then take the necessary actions.

The clients can also view their appointment history in a clean, informative table.

Why the app is the way it is
====
Due to the "mom & pop" nature of the business, there is a tight bond between a stylist and their customers.  Therefore, a minimally intrusive service was all that was necessary to develop a successful product.  I wanted to give customers a quick way to schedule their next hair appointment, including a direct feedback loop (the stylist's text message) should there be a problem meeting the customer's request.

The app is not designed to be a high-traffic site.  It is, rather, a tool and reference source to help customers simplify the process of making an appointment, whenever they want/need.

Planned future expansion
====
I plan on introducing a few extra features for this app, including:

- ActionMailer use for appoinment creation (sent to user) as a confirmation (to be sent after text message is issued)
- Implementation of [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) gem

Therefore, I was able to design th
